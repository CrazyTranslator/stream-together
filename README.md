# Welcome to Stream together üëã
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue.svg?cacheSeconds=2592000)

> Stream any video together with friends without worrying about synchronization

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## üöÄ Usage

To compile the "frontend" (the browser plugin), run
```sh
npm run devContentScript
```

To run the server locally, run
```sh
npm run devServer
```

‚ö† Attention: Webstorm (for some reason) will not execute this script correctly
in WSL. It needs to be executed via the shell (integrated shell is fine), but
the Run tab won't do it.

You'll then need to open [the chrome extensions page](chrome:///extensions)
and add an unpacked extension. Choose this projects folder. You should be
good to go!

## Run tests

```sh
npm test
```
